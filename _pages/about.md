Hello world! This is Demi from the University of Florida, born and raised in [Anyang, China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w83Op5ddaiw). I'm a second-year Linguistics Ph.D. student interested in psycholinguistics and natural language processing. Under the guidance of [Dr. Edith Kaan](https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/directory/dr-edith-kaan/), I'm studying the relationship between code-switch production and cognitive control. I'm also pursuing a Computer Science Ph.D. minor under [Dr. Bonnie Dorr](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/~bonniejdorr) and have served as an RA at the [Culture & NLP lab](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/). My research here involves cognitive modeling and topic modeling. Click on Blog to check out my expanding budget travel stories.
