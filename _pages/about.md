Hello world! This is Demi from UF, born and raised in [Anyang, China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w83Op5ddaiw). I'm a second-year Linguistics Ph.D. student interested in psycholinguistics and natural language processing. Under the guidance of [Dr. Edith Kaan](https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/directory/dr-edith-kaan/), I'm studying the relationship between code-switch production and cognitive control. I'm also pursuing a Computer Science Ph.D. minor under [Dr. Bonnie Dorr](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/~bonniejdorr) and am a member of the [NLP & Culture lab](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/). My research here involves cognitive modeling and topic modeling. 

Adventure is in my soul. I travel on my black Cannondale gravel bike, and some of my recent solo travels have taken me to Mexico, Peru, Egypt, and the UAE. As an active member of the [Warmshowers](https://www.warmshowers.org/user/login?destination=/user/279774/member-reviews) community, I host fellow cyclists and enjoy meeting incredible people who host me in return. This winter, I’m planning a trip to the Colombian Amazon, and my heart’s already soaring with excitement! Click on [Blog](al-folio/blog) to check out my expanding budget travel stories.
